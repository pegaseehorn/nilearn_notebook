    "For easy coding environment management we can use Anaconda / miniconda.\n",

    "- Anaconda (miniconda)\n",
    "- Code editor (e.g. Visual Studio code, Spyder)\n",

    "\n",
    "In the Miniconda prompt let's first ensure that we install the necessary dependencies from an up-to-date and reliable source. Weâ€™ll do this by adding the conda-forge channel and setting it as the default with strict priority.\n",

    "## HPC option:\n",
    "Preferably, we use the high performance compute (HPC) cluster to run our code. The notebook for today is split into different chapters for easy explanation and organisation. But, this also makes it tedious to upload and use the code on the HPC. So, for that you can use the unified code version that you can find in the table of contents under 'HPC version'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either run NiLearn directly in Python on the HPC, for that see the HPC Wiki entry on Conda on the HPC linked in the 'HPC Wiki' section.\n",

    "Today we run the Jupyter Notebook directly in Neurodesk on the HPC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Optional step) Upload the participant data to the HPC either via Nextcloud or SMB. (For more information, look at the HPC Wiki support article linked in this Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "2. Start Neurodesk on the HPC (For more information, look at the HPC Wiki support article linked in this Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "3. Enter the Neurodesk GUI.\n",
    "4. Use Neurodesk to open and run the 'HPC_Version.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook."
